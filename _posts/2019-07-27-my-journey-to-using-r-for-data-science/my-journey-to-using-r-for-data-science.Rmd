Like many analysts, scientists, academics and hobbiest programmers, I use the R
programming language to do what many people now refer to as 'data science'. 

I been doing so for a few years.

It
wasn't always this way.

In
fact, I have mostly stopped using other tools.

It
wasn't always like this.

I
do this almost every day

R has a formiddible ecosystem of related tools to help users.

It bridges many divides.

Programming language wars are misguided. There are advantages and drawbacks to
different tools, but that is all the ultimately are: tools. If a particualr 
tools works for you, then that's more than fine. Don't let anyone try to tell
you.

Everyone should be sceptical about their own tools. Asking the questions like: 
Are they reproducible?
